Dependencies:

* Node js: https://nodejs.org/pt-br/download/
* Gulp Js: https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

How to start:

* Clone the projetc.
* Open a terminal on "development/gulp/" folder and run "npm install".
* Than run "gulp" command.

How it works:

* Build/edit your project at "development" folder.
* Gulp will compile it at "homologation" folder.
* Use "homologation" folder to visualize your current project on the browser.
* When it is done, run the command "gulp deploy" to minify assets at "production" folder.
* Upload all "production" files to your host.
* Thats all
